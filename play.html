        OLLIVANT. [_In a matter-of-fact tone._] Are you sure all this isn't overconfidence and vanity?

        MARY. I don't care what you call it. It's what keeps me working.

        OLLIVANT. [_Quickly._] Working? But how can you work without an engagement?
        
        MARY. That _is_ the hard part of our life; waiting, waiting for a chance
        to work. But don't think I stand still when I haven't an engagement. I
        don't dare. That's why I keep at my voice work and dancing and----

        OLLIVANT. [_Suddenly interrupting._] Dancing and voice work when you
        have no engagements. Would you mind telling me who is paying the bills?

        MARY. [_Indignantly._] Father!

        OLLIVANT. I think I have the right to ask that.

        MARY. Have you?

        OLLIVANT. I am your father.

        MARY. [_With quiet dignity._] You thought you'd force me here at home to
        do as you wished because you paid for my food and clothes; when you took
        that from me you _ceased_ to have that right. Don't forget since I left
        you've not helped me with my work or given me a penny.

        OLLIVANT. [_Suspiciously._] Mary.... No, that's not why you went away from home?

        MARY. No.

        OLLIVANT. Or you met some man _there_ and....

        MARY. No.
