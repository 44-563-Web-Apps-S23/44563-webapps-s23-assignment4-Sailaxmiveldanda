    Are you sure all this isn't overconfidence and vanity?
</p>
<p>
    <h6>MARY.</h6> 
    I don't care what you call it. It's what keeps me working.
</p>
<p>
    <h6>OLLIVANT.</h6>
    <p >[ _Quickly._ ]</p>
    Working? But how can you work without an engagement?<br>
</p>
<p>
    <h6>MARY.</h6>
    <p>That _is_ the hard part of our life; waiting, waiting for a chance to work. 
    But don't think I stand still when I haven't an engagement. I
    don't dare. That's why I keep at my voice work and dancing and----</p>

    <h6>OLLIVANT.</h6>
    <p>[ _Suddenly interrupting._ ]</p>
    Dancing and voice work when you have no engagements. 
    Would you mind telling me who is paying the bills?
</p>
<p>
    <h6>MARY.</h6>
    <p>[ _Indignantly._ ] </p> 
    Father!
</p>
<p>
    <h6>OLLIVANT.</h6>
    think I have the right to ask that.
</p>
<p>
    <h6>MARY.</h6>
    Have you?
</p>
<p>
    <h6>OLLIVANT.</h6>
    I am your father.
</p>
<p>
    <h6>MARY.</h6>
    <p>[ _With quiet dignity._ ] </p>
    You thought you'd force me here at home to do as you wished because you paid for my 
    food and clothes; when you took that from me you _ceased_ to have that right. Don't forget
    since I left you've not helped me with my work or given me a penny.
</p>
<p>
    <h6>OLLIVANT.</h6>
    <p>[ _Suspiciously._ ]</p>
    Mary.... No, that's not why you went away from home?
</p>
<p>
    <h6>MARY.</h6>
    No.
